# Scene Graph Generation
This repository contains code and resources for scene graph generation - the task of extracting structured relational information from images.

## Project-Overview
Scene graph generation aims to produce a graph representation of an image, where:
- Nodes represent objects
- Edges represent relationships between objects

This structured representation can be useful for various downstream tasks like visual question answering, image captioning, and visual reasoning.
